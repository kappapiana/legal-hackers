## What's this?

People often ask who they should consult for libre/free/open source software
matters, particularly those relating to licensing, copyright and copyleft,
patents, and other intellectual property issues.

What follows is a curated public list of those members so that others can get
access to their services. Hopefully this will improve communication and reduce
FUD, while supporting small businesses and consultancies.

## Can anyone join the list?

To be part of this list, you must have at least seven (7) points from the below
criteria in at least three (3) different categories:

- [ ] (1 pt/year, 3 pts max) active participation in a well-known legal discussion group
- [ ] (1 pt) hold a law degree from a recognized university
- [ ] (2 pt/publication, 2 pts max) publish an intermediate to advanced article about legal issues relevant to this list
- [ ] (1 pt/referral, 2 pts max) receive a recommendation from someone on this list
- [ ] (1 pt) demonstrate basic proficiency using the `git` tool

## How to:

Issue a pull request:

- edit the `/individuals.md` file (adding your own entry, in alphabetical order)
- add a file in `/individuals/` (use [individuals/template.md](individuals/template.md))
- your commit comment should follow the following standard: `individual: Add Newname`
(prefix lowercase, colon, the rest capitalized)
- include a self-evaluation checklist in the extended comment, using the template in
[.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

- wait for the result of the automated tests; should your submission fail, look at
the bottom of the log to see what's wrong
- wait for your submission to be approved, fix the warnings you have received
